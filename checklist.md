### Code Fragmentation
Currently ``main.c`` feels more unreadable than it needs to be. It feels like most of the "meat" of the code (the main function) is surrounded by boilerplate that could be macro'd out of existence.

I want to implement game logic first to actually have a good product before I start worrying about unreadable code, so I'm gonna work on that for the rest of today.
